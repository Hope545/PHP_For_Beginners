# PHP_For_Beginners
This repository is for beginners who want to code PHP as a backend programming language, it has all you need to get started!

It has a small admin panel where you can manipulate your own register or login details
Each file has comments, it  tells you about the operation performed and why that operation was performed. Download all the php files with this readme file for assistance 

To create your own database pls follow these steps otherwise you are just on your own!
-start up Xamp as your localhost or local machine
- Open Xamp in your browser thus "http://localhost/" to access the panel where you will create your database
- Click on "myphpadmin" button where it takes you directly to the page you will create your database
- On the far left side pane click on "new" to create a database thus use "starting_php" as your database name, NB: if you decide your own database name remember to edit the config.php file with your new database name
- Create a table in the "starting_php" database with "users" as the table name
- After creating the "users" table, create 5 columns in your table the this order of naming starting from the first thus "id", "firstname", "lastname", "email", "password"
- set the type of data to be in each column to be "varchar" with a size of 255 with the exception of the "id" column which will be "int" with a size of 10 and for the "id" column set Auto Increment or simply click "AI"
- After doing this click submit to prepare your database!


How to navigate through the webpages to get a feel of the backend you will be using
- Open ONLY the file named "register.php" in your browser using the link "http://localhost/yourFolderName/register.php" in a new tab 
- This will lanch the register page for you to navigate through the the entire website
- NB: fill the register form> login form> then it takes you automatically ot the index.php page for a suprise which awaits you there😁 and you will find the "view database" button where you can see your own admin panel!
- You can can make reference to the file to see the code structure and how it was designed.


NB: you can use the database.sql file to create your database if you know how to but if you are an absolute beginner follow the steps and if you encounter any difficulty, leave me a message


Enjoy!
